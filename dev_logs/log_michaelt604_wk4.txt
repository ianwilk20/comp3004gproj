COMP3004 Dev Log - Week #4
Michael Ting - 101068936

Overview: The goal for this week was to implement sliding screens (via touch) and create a foundation to build upon
during reading week.

Weekly Progress:
[2 hr]
- Reserach Swiping through sliding screens
- Test implementation in a standalone app to get the basic concept

[1.5 hr]
- Implementing a swiping screen into the app with fake data

[7 hr] 
- Took steps towards implementing the swipping screen with real data through JSoup
- Many issues caused by JSoup having to be called asyncronously and trying to immediately create the sliding ui without
any data available
- Upon much testing and research it became apparent that the current solution was not going to work as android studio
doesn't like waiting for async tasks to complete in the background
- Got a general solution working by drawing an empty ui and then having the async task result redraw the ui with new 
values when it returns, will need to discuss with group members a solution to the starting blank screen delay
