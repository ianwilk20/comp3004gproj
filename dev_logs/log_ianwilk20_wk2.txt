Development Log – Week #2 
Ian Wilkinson, 101073244

The goal for this week for myself was to remodel how my GroceryList class interacts with the various things it gets returned from the API,
as well as deserializing the API returns into Java objects. In addition, to add some flare to the UI and make it a more appealing exeperience 
for our large user base (jk). As for the breakdown of my week:

Saturday, Febuary 1, 2020
 - [2 Hr] UI Alterations
    o Spent the beginning parts of the day fixing my old design of the Grocery Page to now have a more simplistic and inviting UI
    o Added a list view for grocery items
    o A radio toggle switch to filter between "Aisles" and "Recipe" mode for grocery lists
    o A pop-up dialogue that appears when a user wants to add an item
    o Dialogue features "Add Item", "Cancel",  as well as a Search Bar to query the API for the ingredient
    
 - [1 Hr] Model Changes
    o Implemented models and adjusted folder structure in order to prepare for the eventual parsing and deserialization of API responses
    
 - [3 Hr] Parsing of API Responses
    o Converted the API responses to usable Java objects
    o Java objects stored in HashMap for quick lookup via the key which is the ingredient name (will be store in db soon)
        
 - [1 Hr] Researching
    o Learned more about Volley and how to wait for an API response to then be able to display information on the app
    o Async and sync callback for Volley
    o Struggled/ing with getting volley responses to be parsed then waiting on them, then displaying
    o Investigated automatic toggle of focus for search views when the add ingredient button is pressesed 

 - [1 Hr] Final Touches
    o User can enter an ingredient, add it, it will appear in the list view
    o BUT the ingredient is not queried with the API yet, as there is async issues preventing me from doing so
    
 - [0.5 Hr] Log Writing
