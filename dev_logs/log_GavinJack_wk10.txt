Development Log – Week #10
Gavin Jackson, 101065531

With the last week of development extended there was additional time to iron out more problems. The focus was on polishing and 
regression testing, ensuring the application was working as desired. On top of that there was the push to complete the final 
deliverable.

Tuesday, March 24th, 2020
    -	[0.25 Hr] Stopped navigation bar from being displayed when accessing the recipe browser from the meal planner.
    -	[0.25 Hr] Fixed adding activities via new intents from navigation bar. Originally the meal planner was no longer 
        getting recipes as it did not exist on the back stack.
    -	[0.25 Hr] Fixed meal planner back button at top left. Button would close the app when pressed at the Week plan level, 
        now app remains opened.
    -	[1.0 Hr] Added navigation animation. Default animation was too extensive.
        o	Clicking any activity on bottom nav bar now slides the screen in the correct direction.
        o	Removed flashing click animation from nav bar (breaks during screen animation).
    -	[0.5 Hr] Stopped navigation bar from being displayed when accessing Meal Planner in selection mode. Troubling 
        visual bug (had to use View.GONE, rather than View.HIDE).
    -	[0.25 Hr] Fixed notifications to make their own independent stacks when selected.
    -	[1.0 Hr] Cleaned up application. Changed Nav bar colors, added meal planner title and options title 
        (challenging to add to options activity due to it being a preference activity).

    -	[3.0 Hr] Worked with room db to figure out how to map tables from the database, and their not unique column 
        names, to a POJO object containing two embedded tables. Required prefix in POJO object and ‘as’ statement in 
        query. Created the framework for retrieving the planned meals and their dates (for the purpose of making scheduled 
        meal notifications)
    -	[1.0 Hr] Changed retrieving of scheduled dates to grab all scheduled meals instead of single week. This should 
        simplify the process of scheduling future meals.

Thursday, April 2nd, 2020
    -	[0.25 Hr] Fixed bottom navigation, & back button navigation, for greater usability. Now the application always 
        goes back to main before closing. Required testing with multiply different intent flags, and physical page navigation 
        testing to see if desired outcome was achieved.

Saturday, April 3rd, 2020
    -	[0.25 Hr] Relocated today’s meal fragment to scheduler. It made more logical sense. Broke the activity inside 
        layouts and had to be resolved.
    -	[0.25 Hr] Due to Thursday’s changes had to fix back stack navigation problem regarding Meal Planner, like 
        Tuesday’s problem. Had to change the back stack to always contain main navigation page and one other navigation page.
    -	[1.0 Hr] D4 Report Writing
    -	[0.5 Hr] Log Writing
