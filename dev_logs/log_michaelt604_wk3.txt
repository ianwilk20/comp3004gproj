COMP3004 Dev Log - Week #3
Michael Ting - 101068936

Overview: The goal for this week was to extend the parsing coverage for websites to get the instruction steps
as well as find a good way to display to the UI without a final UI finished for the cooking assistant.

Weekly Progress:
- More reserach on in depth JSoup usage
- Refactored parsing code to increase readibility and effciency
- Refactored UI to better display the temporary recipe steps on the first page
- Added two more sites that can be parsed aside from food52. Those were seriouseats and foodnetwork.
- Did UI research to figure out sliding pages on a finger swipe
