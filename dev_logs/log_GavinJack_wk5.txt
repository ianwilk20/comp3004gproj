Gavin Jackson, 101065531
Goal for the week was finishing up the groundwork of our activities in preparation for connecting our components together. Wanted to 
ensure the Meal Planner was fully functional and ready to accept recipes.

    -	[5.0 Hr] Worked on making recipe recyclerView(fancy list of recipes). Required loads of debugging to resolve numerous problems. 
        Struggles:
        o	Recipes required their own adaptor to be displayed to the user. Needed to remake loads of functionality used for the Plans, 
            to now be used with the recipes.
        o	Added the ability to add recipes [Temporary]. Can show the image, title, and allows for deletion. Still need to link to the 
            recipe browser to get proper recipes instead of temp recipe.
    -	[4.0 Hr] Added order column to PlanMeal. Allows for reordering. Essential for displaying meals for the given day in the order in 
        which the user likes. Ex. When on the main screen of the application there will be a widget to display meals for that day. 
        The order those meals are displayed in is based on their order inside the meal planner. Struggles:
        o	Every time an item shifted by one position it would trigger the command to update database and immediately prevent the user 
            from moving the item any further. Solution was to log list of moves and call update database after the shifting ended.
        o	Had to work with ItemTouchHelper, required research. Needed to know which functions required overriding and which function 
            were optional. Learned the way in which the various functions are called, required for previous point.
    -	[2.0 Hr] Implemented recipe counter for the MealPlanner, shows how many recipes exist in the current plan, shows on each level 
        of the plan. Struggles:
        o	Only thought to implement at the recipe level, when a recipe is added, plus one to higher levels, when a recipe is deleted, 
            minus one from higher levels. Forgot if a meal is deleted then minus the number recipes from the meal from the higher levels.
        o	Realized that not all LiveData was properly being deleted. Every time recipe counter was updated higher level plans were 
            updated, because of this their LiveData observers were triggered. The problem was found in not deleting the LiveData of the 
            current item in the stack before adding another item to the stack. LiveData was only being deleted when items were popped 
            from the stack.
        o	Changed the way in which the counter was displayed, it didn’t look good enough.
    -	[1.0 Hr] Worked on displaying the level of plan and allowing backwards navigation. Struggles:
        o	Needed to double hit back button when on Weekly meal plans page to pop the activity and go back to main. Problem was found 
            in plan stack, two roots existing at the base of the stack. Therefore, needed to hit the button twice before going back
        o	Hard to implement “finish” which allows activity popping. Application was just closing and not going back to main page. 
            Had to change manifest.
    -	[1.0 Hr] During pull request had to resolve merge error, problem with the application. Finally discovered it was a problem with 
        the manifest referring to one activity two times. Made change, committed, informed team that it is good to accept PR.
