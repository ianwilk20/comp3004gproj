Dev  logs:  create  a  “devlogs”  directory.   

Once  the  project  starts,  all  team  members  are  to log weekly their duties/achievements and the time they allocate to these duties.

Dev log’s naming scheme:log_<StudentUsername>_wk<X>.txt, 
  - where <StudentUsername> is the student’s user account in the repo, 
  - and <X> is week’s ID (e.g.,wk1)).  

Starting January 20, there will be 12 weeks, thus, each member is to submit 12 weekly logs.
