Development Log – Week #7
Gavin Jackson, 101065531

There was no particularly large goal this week, besides work on D2. Worked on cleaning up my component and fixing notable errors. 
Trying to ensure all requirements are finished/presentable in preparation for the D3.

    -	[0.5 Hr] Made recipe function to get next week’s recipes given an ID

Wednesday, March 4th, 2020
    -	[0.25 Hr] Made Sunday display first inside meal planner
    -	[1.0 Hr] Fixed on delete cascade problem, if scheduled meal plan were deleted it would delete that whole week from the scheduler. 
        Made new class ScheduleAndPlanWeek to contain weekly meal plan and schedule information, modified query to return new class 
        instead of schedule class. This change was required to make sure the schedules forgot the names of deleted weekly meal plans.
    -	[0.75 Hr] Debugged previous, fixed double schedule display problem. Added ‘no meal plan’ indicator.
    -	[0.75 Hr] Fixed constraints of all items in all recyclerviews managed by me. Text no longer spills under other objects 
        within the item. Added horizontal lines to plan item to enhance the distinction between two plans.
    -	[0.25 Hr] Modified plan adaptor when in selection mode, no longer traverses can traverse plans like before.
    -	[0.25 Hr] Fixed double recipe problem, if there were two recipes and one was deleted both would be removed. Happened across 
        plans/meals.
    -	[0.75 Hr] Removed floating action button when selecting plan for scheduler. Completely forgot this was being controlled else 
        where in the code, couldn’t understand why the fab was still being displayed after calling hide.
