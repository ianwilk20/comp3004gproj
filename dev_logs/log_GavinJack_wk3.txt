Development Log – Week #3
Gavin Jackson, 101065531

Work for this week pertained to the implementation of adding new Plans at the various depths (Week, Day, individual meal). There was many
problems stemming from my git commits which required time to fix. Moreover, working with Android Studio has been more challenging then 
anticipated, especially that of the ‘Room’ database.

    -	[1.0 Hr] Merge conflict resolution. Reverted revert of week 2 work. Fixed null references a that were supposed to have been 
    deleted. Got Master in functional state.

    -	[1.0 Hr] Conceptualized how to retrieve plans and simulate the level of plans, from week -> day -> meal -> recipes. Began slowly
    implementing ‘Create’ functionality for the various levels of planning.

    -	[1.0 Hr] Continued working on implementing the ‘Create’ functionality.
    -	[1.0 Hr] Worked on debugging. Decided to delete the level property from the Plan class. This led to a need for a migration route
    for new database. After many failed attempts of creating a migration route it was found (after many searches) that the app on the VM
    could be deleted and no schema references would be saved. Migration to the new schema would no longer be required.
    -	[3.0 Hr] Worked on debugging Foreign Key Error. Whenever new Week Meal plans were inserted into the database upon initial set up,
    it would abruptly give a foreign key error.
        o	Attempted changing order of thread operation between inserting the parent ‘Week Meal Plan,’ and the children ‘Day Meal Plan.’
        o	Modified the schema of the database as multiple sources suggested the Android database room does not properly auto generate IDs
        when given a default value of zero. Instead migrated over to using Long, as default value is null and that is was the database
        gives back after an insert.
        o	The root of the problem stemmed from a race condition when the app started. Initially it would try to delete all the plans and 
        prepopulate the database. However, both actions were done in two different threads. The solution was to stop deleting all the plans 
        and to stop prepopulating the database at the start.
