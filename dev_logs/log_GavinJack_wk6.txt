Development Log – Week #6
Gavin Jackson, 101065531
Being the last week of production before D2 it was critical that all members connected their functional components together. 
Everyone’s component, to some degree, requires information from another component. For a proper demo it makes sense to ensure 
all the connections are made to show the full potential of the application and that of the individual components.

    -	[0.75 Hr] Groundwork for connection with Recipe Browser. Made the framework for displaying recipes already in the Meal Planner 
        via rbSelected. Made the framework for connecting to rbActivity for finding new recipes and adding them to the Meal Planner. 
        Reorganized filenames and removed warnings from PlanRecipeRecyclerView.
    -	[1.0 Hr] Fixed oversight on Primary key inside recipe class, thought it couldn’t be a long so changed to string, realized it 
        should be long and changed back, only to properly realize that it must be a string. Struggled launching fragment that displays 
        the meals/recipes of the current day. Main activity needed to implement abstract class.
    -	[2.0 Hr] Worked on fragments
        o	Made TodayMeal fragment 
        o	Made the Today Meal Recycler view for displaying the meals for today. Created the Today Meal item, along required adapter 
            for displaying purposes.
        o	Made the Today Recipe Recycler view to be displayed inside each Today Meal item. Created Today Recipe item, and the 
            required adapter.
    -	[1.0Hr] Created a scheduler class for storing the meal plan chosen for any given week. Prepopulated the database with all 
        weeks of the year pointing to the first weekly meal plan returned by the database.

    -	[1.0 Hr] General tasks:
        o	Debugged dao, instead of returning the meals for one day it was returning the meals for all days within the weekly plan. 
            Database required the use of LIKE when comparing two strings not ==.
        o	Changed layout of main activity, changed to constraint layout.
        o	Touched up Today’s Meals fragment.
    -	[1.0 Hr] Made scheduler into a fragment just like the Today’s Meals fragment (Made recycler view, recycler view item, added 
        to main activity, created adapter, etc.). Debugged incorrect spelling of fragment, one reference inside of main activity 
        was incorrectly spelled but not problematic enough to trigger compile time error.
    -	[1.0 Hr] Implemented a recycler view dot page indicator, shown at the bottom of the horizontal recycler view for displaying 
        todays meals is a series of dots, the active page is represented by a blue dot. Got schedule widget to display weekly meal 
        plan names. Added “NOTHING PLANNED” indicator for both the scheduler and the today’s meals.
    -	[1.0 Hr] Modified Meal Planner activity, created select button and added way for the activity to return the id of a weekly 
        meal plan. Had to ensure the select button was only displayed when activity was made with the desire for a return value, 
        and that the select button would only show at the weekly meal plan level.
    -	[0.5 Hr] Added sorting of scheduler. Shows the current week first, followed by all subsequent weeks in order.
    -	[2.5 Hr] Merge conflict problems. Solution boiled down to merging into master local, making new branch, then making a 
        PR for the new branch and closing the old PR request with merge conflicts. Also required to test new branch before 
        approving PR and still making modifications. Many branches were made, many PR requests opened then closed, attempts 
        to revert were taken…this was certainly a big ordeal.

    -	[1.0 Hr] Continued merge conflict resolution. Although my branch was fixed, many other branches still needed fixing. 
        Ensured all members merged and deleted their branches. Full team wide reset.
    -	[1.0 Hr] Fixed recyclerview items in TodayRecipeRecyclerView. Original set up would have led to memory leak problems 
        due to the creation of LiveData observers, without their later deletion. 
    -	[0.5 Hr] Fixed recipe items in Today’s Meals Fragment, recipes were not being displayed because incorrect view was 
        being provided to the holder.

    -	[0.5 Hr] Created component diagram.

Sunday, March 1st, 2020
    -	[0.75 Hr]  Log Writing.
