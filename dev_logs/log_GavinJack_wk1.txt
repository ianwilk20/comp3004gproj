Development Log – Week #1 
Gavin Jackson, 101065531

As this was the first week of development the goal for each person was quite broad and solely based on our functional requirements, as
outlined in the pitch. I had the task of starting work on the Meal Planner. Everyone in the group was given the broad goal of reviewing
the requirements and going about any rough implementation. The hope is to develop our project management skills and better outline
weekly expectations as the weeks progress. As for the breakdown of my week:

Sunday, Jan 26, 2020
 - [1 Hr] Page Planning
    o Spent the beginning parts of the day designing rough conceptual models of the Meal Planner, and different ways to store all of the
    information.
    
    o Decided on a way to store the meal planner information in a 4-tiered system, starting from WeekMealPlan -> DayMealPlan -> Meal ->
    Recipe. This accommodates for the complexities of everyone having the greatest possibility of fitting anyone’s schedule and needs
    (multiple meals in a day, many recipes per dish, 7 different days a week, etc)
    
    o Briefly looked at the ways in which the information can be displayed to the user to be meaningful. Designs are tentative but the
    solution is closer.
    
 - [0.75 Hr] Researched SQL related services in the context of Android Studio Development
    o Developed a better understanding of making an entity using a class and how it interacts with the database.
    
    o SQL Databases would be the best for storing all parts of the meal plan and would make it much easier to use old collections (Meal,
    DayMealPlan, and WeekMealPlan) for new meal plans.
    
 - [4 Hr] Developed Structure of the Meal Planner
    o Converted the planned models into the designated classes.
    
    o Fluctuated between many ways of achieving the same outcome:
         Using an interface versus an abstract class for all the Planner elements (Meal, DayMealPlan, and WeekMealPlan). Decided on
        abstract class as it gave more versatility in making all the children have a certain set of class properties.
         Debated using simple filesystem saving instead of Databases to avoid potential complications. As it stands there is a
        filesystem saving and loading setup, yet highly subject to change.
         Looked over having a strict naming convention system for new meals, each meal can have a standard name or custom name. Idea 
        terminated.
        
 - [1 Hr] Testing and Understanding Android Studio
    o Learned more about Android Studio, worked through errors arising from my code and familiarized myself with the various windows
    
    o Struggled with committing my work. Learned how to make a separate branch and how to commit to it. This made version controlling
    our work easier as a pull request to merge with master is much easier to revert then committing directly to master and affecting
    other branches. Also learned how to ensure a commit is pushed to git.
    
 - [0.75 Hr] Researched Android Page Views 
    o Analyzed the various default views of an android page. Investigated Frame View, Bottom Navigation View, amongst others, to
    identify what can work best to display the information to the user.
    
 - [0.5 Hr] Log Writing
