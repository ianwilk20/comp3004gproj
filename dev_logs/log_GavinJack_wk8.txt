Work pertained to D3, and continued touch ups. Primary focus on completing requirements.

    -	[2.0 Hr] Added schedule times. When changing the ordering of meals, schedule times maintain given order. Moved meal ordering 
        logic out of repo and into view model.
    -	[3.5 Hr] Worked on notifications. Made 3 different notifications.
        o	Looked into how to initiate function such that it calls onActivityResult. Required to simulate the selection of a weekly 
            meal plan for next week, as per one of the notifications.
        o	Made proxy activity that does get onActivityResult to save and store the selected weekly meal plan.
        o	Notifications are difficult to work with. Tried forever to get smooth screen changes.
