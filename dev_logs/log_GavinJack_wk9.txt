Development Log – Week #9
Gavin Jackson, 101065531

Considering the coronavirus situation workflow has been heavily impacted. Our group has been working together to finish up the 
remaining pieces of the application. Most requirements of our application are now completed, and we are shifting our focus to 
final touch ups. A major problem that has plagued the development of our application was a lacking flow between each member’s 
components. As such, I worked on recreating the navigation of the application. My contribution for the ninth development week 
was creating the bottom navigation view bar and getting all the components working together.

    -	[6.0 Hr] Loads of refactoring. Changed location of multiple components, made sure everything was matching the same scheme. 
        Made new bottom navigation view menu, worked on all activity layouts to make sure it was working properly. Changed layout of 
        main activity as it no longer required its crazy cluster of navigation objects (as navigation was shifted to navigation bar).

    -	[2.0 Hr] Fixed bug with options activity. Required understanding of the how the activity was being loaded using preference 
        xml rather than standard layout. Solution required taking the preferences and stopping it from loading in a layout. Instead 
        the layout is loaded in first and a container within the layout is replaced for the preferences.
    -	[0.5 Hr] Log Writing.
