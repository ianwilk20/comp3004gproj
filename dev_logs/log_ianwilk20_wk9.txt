The goal for this week was to fix bugs and add any features we discussed in our scrum meeting that pertain to this component of the app.

Tuesday, March 17, 2020 to Sunday, March 29, 2020
 - [1 Hr] Bug Fix and Testing
	- When multiple API requests failed because of limited calls to API, it would show multiple alert dialogs 
	- This is fixed, now it'll check if an alert dialog already on screen and if so it won't create another
	- Testing API through-put

 - [0.5 Hr] Using Recipe Interface
	- Using "Recipe" interface as opposed to the attributes directly
	- Tested interface ensure that the new usage works with grocery list's next week meal plan's import feature

	- Made the following sections for the D3 doc:
		- Singleton Design Pattern

		- Grocery List Work Delegation
	- Designed part of the powerpoint presentation

 - [2 Hr] D3 Preparation
	- Reviewed and wrote notes on the architecture styles and design patterns that my group partners integrated in the application
