Development Log â€“ Week #2
Gavin Jackson, 101065531
The goal of this week was to implement a versatile Database that we can all use to keep our data in. The hope of the Database would be to
improve connection between our functional components. Rather than passing an entire dataset of instantiated objects (such as recipes), we
can pass a list of recipe Ids. Additionally, using the Database makes for a much more convenient way of storing persistent information
rather than constructing our own file storage system.

	-	[1.5 Hr] Constructed Rough Model of the Database
		o	Constructed entities for data storage. Plan, PlanRecipe, & Recipe
		o	Created data access object (DAO) for direct SQL query support and database interaction
		o	Implemented Database class to unify all database calls, ensuring only one database exists and that no time-consuming calls bog
			down the main thread.
		o	Created Repository for data acquisition. The hope is that the repository will be the able to distinguish whether a local cached
			database call will suffice or if a call to the API is required.
		o	Began implemented ViewModel with LiveData for future database testing.
	-	[2.0 Hr] Worked on solving git related issues / android studio related issues. resolved problems
		o	Consulted with group and had commits to master restricted to Pull Request with one other user review.
		o	Learned the ways of git Bash.
